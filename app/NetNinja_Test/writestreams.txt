Insurance Industry Jumppstart




What are the key activities of the Insurance industry? How does it function?

The following are the key activities of the Insurance Industry:
- Underwriting,
- Customer Support,
- Product Development,
- Marketing,
- Sales and Distribution,
- Investment Management,
- Policy Management,
- Claim Administration
Each of the above activities play an important function in the insurance industry. From the very beginning of marketing an insurance product to a potential customer which may lead to a sale of a policy from the organization. The insurance organization can then invest the premium paid by the customer to generate addition income. A customer can use customer support to make a potential claim or resolve any other issues. To remain competitive and increase profit, new insurance related product must be developed.


What are the primary segments within the Insurance industry?  How would you define them?

1. Life Insurance
Life insurance is an agreement between an insurance organization and a policyholder, where the insurer provides financial benefits to a designated person on either the death of the insured person or after a set period of time. The designated person is thereby safeguarded from the financial impact of the death of the insured. Life insurance policies may be for a fixed or an indefinite period.

2. General Insurance
Also known as Non-life insurance, General Insurance is any kind of insurance policy other than a life insurance policy. These include auto insurance, travel insurance, property insurance etc.. This segment of insurance compensates the losses incurred for a policyholder from a particular event.

3. Reinsurance
Reinsurance is where an insurance organization passes on (purchases) some part of its own insurance liabilities to another insurance organization to protect themselves from the risk of a major claims event.



In your opinion, what is the most significant trend affecting the Insurance industry at the moment?  Please explain why you feel this represents either an opportunity or a threat to the industry (or your client).

It's already clear that the pandemic has hastened the trend towards remote working, and the insurance industry is no different in allowing many of its employees to work from home for at least part of the week.

The obvious benefits of remote working include more flexibility for staff, which in turn leads to boosted staff morale and greater accessibility for working parents and other staff with complex personal circumstances.

However, remote working is also leading to a fragmented workforce, with the strains of remote working taking their toll on workforce collaboration and dynamics. Partially this divide is caused by distance, and partially by fragmented staff structures which subject one set of staff members to a different ruleset than another.

The solution to this will involve insurers taking steps to introduce effective employee engagement strategies to keep staff invested in their company, and many brokers will no doubt be expecting insurers to return to the office on at least a part-time basis.

The obvious benefits of remote working include more flexibility for staff, which in turn leads to boosted staff morale and greater accessibility for working parents and other staff with complex personal circumstances.

However, remote working is also leading to a fragmented workforce, with the strains of remote working taking their toll on workforce collaboration and dynamics. Partially this divide is caused by distance, and partially by fragmented staff structures which subject one set of staff members to a different ruleset than another.

The solution to this will involve insurers taking steps to introduce effective employee engagement strategies to keep staff invested in their company, and many brokers will no doubt be expecting insurers to return to the office on at least a part-time basis.

What are the key activities of the Insurance industry? How does it function?

The following are the key activities of the Insurance Industry:
- Underwriting,
- Customer Support,
- Product Development,
- Marketing,
- Sales and Distribution,
- Investment Management,
- Policy Management,
- Claim Administration
Each of the above activities play an important function in the insurance industry. From the very beginning of marketing an insurance product to a potential customer which may lead to a sale of a policy from the organization. The insurance organization can then invest the premium paid by the customer to generate addition income. A customer can use customer support to make a potential claim or resolve any other issues. To remain competitive and increase profit, new insurance related product must be developed.


What are the primary segments within the Insurance industry?  How would you define them?

1. Life Insurance
Life insurance is an agreement between an insurance organization and a policyholder, where the insurer provides financial benefits to a designated person on either the death of the insured person or after a set period of time. The designated person is thereby safeguarded from the financial impact of the death of the insured. Life insurance policies may be for a fixed or an indefinite period.

2. General Insurance
Also known as Non-life insurance, General Insurance is any kind of insurance policy other than a life insurance policy. These include auto insurance, travel insurance, property insurance etc.. This segment of insurance compensates the losses incurred for a policyholder from a particular event.

3. Reinsurance
Reinsurance is where an insurance organization passes on (purchases) some part of its own insurance liabilities to another insurance organization to protect themselves from the risk of a major claims event.

The designated person is thereby safeguarded from the financial impact of the death of the insured. Life insurance policies may be for a fixed or an indefinite period.

2. General Insurance
Also known as Non-life insurance, General Insurance is any kind of insurance policy other than a life insurance policy. These include auto insurance, travel insurance, property insurance etc.. This segment of insurance compensates the losses incurred for a policyholder from a particular event.

3. Reinsurance
Reinsurance is where an insurance organization passes on (purchases) some part of its own insurance liabilities to another insurance organization to protect themselves from the risk of a major claims event.



In your opinion, what is the most significant trend affecting the Insurance industry at the moment?  Please explain why you feel this represents either an opportunity or a threat to the industry (or your client).

It's already clear that the pandemic has hastened the trend towards remote working, and the insurance industry is no different in allowing many of its employees to work from home for at least part of the week.

The obvious benefits of remote working include more flexibility for staff, which in turn leads to boosted staff morale and greater accessibility for working parents and other staff with complex personal circumstances.

However, remote working is also leading to a fragmented workforce, with the strains of remote working taking their toll on workforce collaboration and dynamics. Partially this divide is caused by distance, and partially by fragmented staff structures which subject one set of staff members to a different ruleset than another.

The solution to this will involve insurers taking steps to introduce effective employee engagement strategies to keep staff invested in their company, and many brokers will no doubt be expecting insurers to return to the office on at least a part-time basis.

What are the key activities of the Insurance industry? How does it function?

The following are the key activities of the Insurance Industry:
- Underwriting,
- Customer Support,
- Product Development,
- Marketing,
- Sales and Distribution,
- Investment Management,
- Policy Management,
- Claim Administration
Each of the above activities play an important function in the insurance industry. From the very beginning of marketing an insurance product to a potential customer which may lead to a sale of a policy from the organization. The insurance organization can then invest the premium paid by the customer to generate addition income. A customer can use customer support to make a potential claim or resolve any other issues. To remain competitive and increase profit, new insurance related product must be developed.


What are the primary segments within the Insurance industry?  How would you define them?
